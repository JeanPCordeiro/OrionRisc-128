# OrionRisc-128 System Software Development Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the complete development sequence for OrionRisc-128's system software, following a strict bootstrap development approach. The plan ensures progressive complexity while maintaining the self-hosting philosophy where each development tool enables the creation of the next.

## Bootstrap Development Philosophy
