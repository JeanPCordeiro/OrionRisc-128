## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Test Framework Issues**
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
   - Check that source files are in correct locations
   - Verify Node.js version compatibility

2. **System Initialization Failures**
   - Check hardware component dependencies
   - Verify memory layout configuration
   - Validate system call handler registration

3. **Program Execution Issues**
   - Confirm program data format is correct
   - Check memory address boundaries
   - Validate instruction encoding

4. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor system resource usage
   - Check for memory leaks
   - Validate timing measurement accuracy

### Debug Mode

Run tests with additional debugging:

```bash
# Enable verbose output
DEBUG=orionrisc:* node tests/integration/test-runner.js

# Run specific test with debugging
DEBUG=orionrisc:* node tests/integration/system-bootstrap-test.js
```
