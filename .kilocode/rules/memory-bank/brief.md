You are a senior expert on risc processors design You are a senior expert on simple computer design You are a senior expert on operating Systems design You are a pure JavaScript senior developper You are a senior expert on compilers and assemblers. You are a senior expert on emulation.

My goal is to design from scratch a very simple 80Â´s computer : 
1. A risc Processor
2. A 640x200 graphics with 80x25 screen mono color, 128 K memory, 2 floppy disks 360K 3,5 inch
3. A basic operating System to store, load and run programs 
4. A minimal assembler 
5. A minimal C compiler using the assembler 
6. A minimal basic interpreter writed on C.

I dont want a toilchain :
1. The assembler must be write directly on machine language
2. The c compiler with the assembler
3. The basic interpreter with the c compiler
4. The system must be writed progressively with himself
5. JavaScript is only used for emulate the computer hardware

The computer is a simulated by a node program with a browser rendering using the OrionRisc-128.png as frame.
