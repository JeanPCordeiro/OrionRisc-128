# OrionRisc-128 - Product Definition

## Why This Project Exists

OrionRisc-128 is an educational and hobbyist project that demonstrates the complete design and implementation of a vintage 1980s-style computer system from the ground up. It serves as a comprehensive learning platform for understanding:

- **Low-level systems architecture** - How processors, memory, and I/O systems work together
- **Compiler construction** - Building programming language tools from scratch
- **Operating system design** - Creating system software that manages hardware resources
- **Bootstrap development** - Building complex systems incrementally without external toolchains
- **Computer history** - Recreating the experience of 1980s computing technology

## Problems It Solves

### Educational Gap
Most modern programmers never experience building systems from the hardware level up. This project bridges that gap by providing a hands-on platform to understand:

- How RISC processors execute instructions
- Memory management and addressing schemes
- File system implementation on storage devices
- Graphics rendering at the hardware level
- Compiler pipeline construction
- Operating system kernel development

### Accessibility
Building real hardware systems requires expensive equipment and specialized knowledge. OrionRisc-128 provides:

- **Zero-cost entry** - Runs in any modern web browser
- **Safe experimentation** - No risk of damaging physical hardware
- **Visual feedback** - See the computer in action through the authentic 80s interface
- **Step-by-step progression** - Build complexity gradually with clear milestones

## How It Should Work

### System Architecture
The OrionRisc-128 operates as a complete computer system with:

1. **RISC Processor** - Custom 32-bit RISC CPU with 16 registers
2. **Memory System** - 128KB RAM with memory-mapped I/O
3. **Graphics** - 640x200 monochrome display with 80x25 text mode
4. **Storage** - Two 360KB floppy disk drives for program and data storage
5. **Operating System** - Minimal OS providing program loading, storage management, and basic I/O

### Development Bootstrap Process
The system is built progressively without external toolchains:

1. **Machine Language** - Direct binary programming of the RISC processor
2. **Assembler** - Written in machine language to translate assembly to binary
3. **C Compiler** - Written in assembly language to compile C code
4. **BASIC Interpreter** - Written in C to provide high-level programming
5. **Operating System** - Extended with features written in compiled languages

### User Experience

#### For Learners
- **Interactive Learning** - See code running in real-time on emulated hardware
- **Progressive Complexity** - Start with simple programs, build to complex systems
- **Visual Feedback** - Watch the computer execute instructions step by step
- **Historical Context** - Experience computing as it was in the 1980s

#### For Developers
- **Complete System View** - Understand how all components interconnect
- **Debugging Tools** - Inspect processor state, memory contents, and I/O operations
- **Performance Analysis** - Measure instruction timing and system performance
- **Extensibility** - Add new instructions, peripherals, or capabilities

## User Experience Goals

### Simplicity
