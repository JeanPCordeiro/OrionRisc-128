# OrionRisc-128 - Current Context

## Current Work Focus
Project initialization and memory bank setup. No source code implementation exists yet.

## Recent Changes
- Memory bank initialization requested
- Project structure analysis completed
- Core memory bank files being created

## Next Steps
1. Complete memory bank initialization with architecture.md and tech.md
2. Begin hardware emulation layer implementation in JavaScript
3. Design and implement the RISC processor core
4. Create basic memory management system
5. Implement graphics and storage subsystems
