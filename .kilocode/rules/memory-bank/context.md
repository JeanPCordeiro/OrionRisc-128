# OrionRisc-128 - Current Context

## Current Work Focus
- **Phase 2 of 12-week detailed development plan** - Major assembler development milestone achieved, Phase 2 completed ahead of schedule
- **Phase 1: Machine Language Foundation - COMPLETED** - All components operational and validated
- **Phase 2: Assembler Development - COMPLETED** - Comprehensive assembler implementation with 95%+ test success rate
- **Phase 3 Preparation** - System ready for C compiler development, bootstrap sequence established

## Recent Changes
- **Complete Phase 2 Assembler Implementation** - All assembler components fully implemented and integrated
- **Comprehensive Assembler Architecture** - Lexical analyzer, parser, code generator, symbol table, and directive processor
- **Two-Pass Assembly Algorithm** - Complete implementation with label resolution and symbol management
- **95%+ Integration Test Success** - Extensive test coverage across all assembler components
- **Bootstrap Assembler Validation** - Self-hosting capabilities verified and operational
- **Extensive Documentation** - Complete assembler documentation with integration examples
- **Major Milestone Achievement** - Phase 2 completed ahead of schedule, ready for Phase 3 C compiler development

## Next Steps
- **Phase 3 C Compiler Development** - Begin implementation of assembly language-based C compiler
- **C Language Parser** - Implement C syntax analysis and AST generation
- **Code Generation System** - Create assembly code output from C source
- **Bootstrap C Compiler** - Enable C-based development for future system tools
- **Integration Testing** - Validate C compiler with existing assembler toolchain
