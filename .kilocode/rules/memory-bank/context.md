# OrionRisc-128 - Current Context

## Current Work Focus
Hardware emulation layer implementation completed. All core hardware components are now functional and tested.

## Recent Changes
- Complete hardware emulation layer implemented in JavaScript
- RISC processor with full ISA implemented and tested
- 128KB memory management system with I/O support
- 640x200 monochrome graphics with text mode
- Floppy disk emulation (2x 360KB drives)
- I/O abstraction layer with device management
- Browser-based emulator interface with debugging tools
- Comprehensive test suites for processor and graphics

## Next Steps
1. Begin Layer 2: Machine language foundation development
2. Create machine code programming utilities
3. Implement basic debugging facilities at hardware level
4. Test processor with simple machine language programs
5. Prepare foundation for self-hosted assembler (Layer 3)
