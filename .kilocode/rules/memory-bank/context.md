# OrionRisc-128 - Current Context

## Current Work Focus
- **Project Initialization** - Memory bank setup and project planning
- **Pre-Implementation Phase** - No source code exists yet, preparing to start development

## Recent Changes
- **Memory Bank Initialization** - Created all core memory bank files (product.md, context.md, architecture.md, tech.md)
- **Project Analysis** - Analyzed existing minimal project structure
- **Architecture Documentation** - Completed system architecture design with Mermaid diagrams
- **Technology Stack** - Documented development technologies, dependencies, and patterns

## Next Steps
- **Implementation Planning** - Plan step-by-step development approach with detailed task breakdown
- **Start Development** - Begin with RISC processor emulation in JavaScript
- **Component Implementation** - Implement CPU, memory, graphics, and storage components
- **Bootstrap Development** - Build assembler, C compiler, and BASIC interpreter progressively
